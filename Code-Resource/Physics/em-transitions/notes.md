# Electromagnetic transitions in nuclei

Defining the key concepts of the electromagnetic spectrum and the electromagnetic transitions in nuclei.

In a quantum system, the nucleus can be at an initial energy state $E_0$. The nucleus will emit radiation that is proportional with its initial energy state,, such that the freqeuncy of the emitted radiation is proportional to the energy of the nucleus.
