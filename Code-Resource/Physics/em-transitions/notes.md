# Electromagnetic transitions in nuclei

Defining the key concepts of the electromagnetic spectrum and the electromagnetic transitions in nuclei.

In a quantum system, the nucleus can be at an initial energy state $E_0$. The nucleus will emit radiation that is proportional with its initial energy state,, such that the frequency of the emitted radiation is proportional to the energy of the nucleus.

For a nucleus with a given initial energy state $E_0$, one can evaluate the wave-function which describes the nuclear state. The total wave-function of the nucleus can be written as a product between a wave-function of the position vector $\vec{r}$ and an exponential function of the form $\exp{-iE_0t/\hbar}$ where $E_0$ is the initial energy of the nucleus.
